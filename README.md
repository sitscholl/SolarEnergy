# SolarEnergy
Python code to calculate solar energy at a given location

# Description

Photovoltaic (PV) panels convert sunlight directly into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. In simple terms, when sunlight (made of photons) strikes a semiconductor material (usually silicon), it excites electrons—freeing them to flow as an electrical current. This process is the basis for generating electricity in PV cells, which are connected in arrays (panels) to form a PV system.

Below is an overview covering how this energy is generated and measured, the units used, how to convert solar radiation values into electrical energy, typical efficiency figures, and an example calculation.

## How PV Energy Is Generated and Measured

### Generation Process
Photon Absorption: When photons hit the semiconductor, they can knock electrons from their atoms, creating electron–hole pairs.

Charge Separation: A built-in electric field (from the p–n junction) separates these charges, driving electrons through an external circuit to produce current.

Electricity Production: The generated direct current (DC) is then typically converted to alternating current (AC) for use in homes or for grid injection.

### Measurement Units

- Kilowatt (kW): A unit of power, representing the rate of energy generation (or consumption) at any moment. For instance, a 1 kW system can produce 1 kWh in one hour under constant operation.
- Kilowatt-hour (kWh): A unit of energy. It is the amount of energy generated (or consumed) when 1 kW of power is sustained for one hour.
- Kilowatt-peak (kWp): This is the nominal (or “nameplate”) power rating of a PV system measured under Standard Test Conditions (STC: 1000 W/m² irradiance, 25°C cell temperature, and AM1.5 spectral conditions). It represents the maximum output the system could achieve under ideal conditions—even though actual production is usually lower due to real-world losses.

## Converting Solar Radiation to Electrical Energy

### Solar Radiation Data from Tools
Tools like the r.sun tool in GRASS GIS or the Feature Solar Radiation tool in ArcGIS calculate the solar resource at a given location. They typically output values in:

- W/m² (watts per square meter): Instantaneous power density.
- kWh/m²/day (kilowatt-hours per square meter per day): Daily energy received per unit area.

### Transformation Process

1. Determine Incident Energy:

Multiply the daily solar irradiation (in kWh/m²/day) by the area (in m²) of the PV array.
For example, if a site receives 5 kWh/m²/day and you have 10 m² of panels, the incident energy is 5 × 10 = 50 kWh/day.
Apply PV Conversion Efficiency:

The panels convert only a fraction of the incident energy into electrical energy. This conversion efficiency typically ranges from about 15% to 20% for common crystalline silicon panels.

2. Multiply the incident energy by the panel efficiency to obtain the theoretical electrical output.
3. Account for System Losses:

In real-world conditions, additional losses occur due to factors such as temperature, shading, soiling, inverter conversion (DC to AC), wiring, and mismatch losses. These are often collectively represented by a “performance ratio” (PR) typically around 0.75–0.85.

4. Multiply by the PR to estimate the actual energy output.

## Representative Efficiency and Loss Values

Panel Efficiency:
Commercial silicon panels usually have efficiencies of about 15–20%. High-performance panels might reach up to 22%.

Performance Ratio (PR):
Overall system losses (including inverter, wiring, temperature, and shading losses) typically reduce the effective yield by 15–25% (PR ≈ 0.75–0.85).

Inverter Losses:
Usually account for an additional 2–5% loss.

Temperature Effects & Soiling:
Can cause further reductions of a few percent depending on local conditions.
Thus, while the ideal conversion efficiency under STC might be around 18–20%, the actual effective efficiency (after all losses) might be closer to 14–17%.

## Example Calculation

Scenario:
A location receives an average of 5 kWh/m²/day of solar energy on a tilted surface. You have a PV array with a total area of 10 m², the panels have a conversion efficiency of 18%, and the overall system performance ratio is 0.8.

Step 1: Calculate Total Incident Energy

Incident Energy = Irradiation × Area = 5 kWh/m²/day × 10m² = 50 kWh/day
Incident Energy = Irradiation × Area = 5kWh/m²/day × 10m²= 50kWh/day

Step 2: Calculate Theoretical Electrical Output

Theoretical Output = Incident Energy × Panel Efficiency = 50kWh/day × 0.18 = 9 kWh/day
Theoretical Output=Incident Energy × Panel Efficiency = 50kWh/day × 0.18=9kWh/day

Step 3: Apply Performance Ratio to Estimate Actual Output

Actual Output = Theoretical Output × PR = 9 kWh/day × 0.8 = 7.2 kWh/day
Actual Output = Theoretical Output × PR = 9kWh/day  ×0.8 = 7.2kWh/day

This means that under these conditions, your PV array would produce about 7.2 kWh of electrical energy per day.

## Summary
- Energy Generation: PV cells absorb sunlight to free electrons, generating DC electricity.
- Key Units:
kW measures power (instantaneous rate).
kWh measures energy (power over time).
kWp indicates peak (nominal) power under ideal conditions.
- Conversion from Solar Radiation:
Multiply the incident irradiation (kWh/m²) by the area (m²), then by the panel efficiency and the performance ratio to obtain the actual electrical energy output.
- Typical Efficiencies:
Panels: ~15–20%; System PR: ~0.75–0.85.
- Example:
A 10 m² array in a 5 kWh/m²/day environment with 18% efficiency and 80% PR yields ~7.2 kWh/day.
This framework allows you to transform solar radiation values (as obtained from tools like r.sun or ArcGIS) into practical estimates of electrical energy output for a given PV installation.
